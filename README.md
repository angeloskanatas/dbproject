# HFRI (ELIDEK) database implementation project
A simple implementation for the needs of HFRI institute made with Flask framework (Python) for the backend, Jinja template engine, HTML and CSS styling for the frontend.

Team: Angelos-Nikolaos Kanatas, Georgios Triantafyllis, Ioannis Asprogerakas

## Prerequisite installation steps for Linux (Debian Core):

#### Get the latest version of Python and Flask framework:

``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.8
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Download SQL development packages:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

## Prerequisite installation steps for macOS:

#### Download SQL development packages with homebrew package manager:

##### Homebrew package manager is needed to execute the following terminal instructions. 
##### You can find more about that here: https://brew.sh/index_el

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install mysql
```

#### Get the latest version of Python and Flask framework:

``` bash
brew install python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Open a terminal and precede the `mysql` command with `sudo` to invoke it with the privileges of the root Ubuntu user in order to gain access to the root MySQL user. This can be done using  
`sudo mysql -u root -p`.
2. Create a new MySQL user using:  
`mysql> CREATE USER 'HFRI_admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';`
3. Grant the user root privileges on the application's database using:  
`mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON HFRI.* TO 'HFRI_admin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;`
4. Reload the grant tables to ensure that the new privileges are put into effect using:
`FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`.
5. Exit MySQL with `mysql> exit;`.
7. Go to `HFRI/__init__.py` and change the `app.config["MYSQL_USER"]` and `app.config["MYSQL_PASSWORD"]` lines according to the username and the password you chose before.
8. Open the `sql` directory, type `sudo mysql -u root -p` and `source schema.sql`, `source insert-data.sql`, `source queries.sql` to create the database and pass all the nesessery data for it to work.  

##### If you are using macOS be carefull because Tables_in_HFRI migth be lowercase and that is going to cause some misfunctions. To solve that you have to manually change the variable Tables_in_HFRI -> Tables_in_hfri in the show_tables.html file located in the templates directory.

### To run the app type: 
```python 
python3 run.py
``` 
### After that the app will run at http://localhost:5000/. Finally login to the database throught the web app by using the same credentials as shown before for MySQL user so you can be able to manipulate data of the database.
